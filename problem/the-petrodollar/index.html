Almost 7 million were civilians. Somewhere between 50 and 80 million were killed in the second world war. Most were civilians. This tragedy was punctuated with nuclear bombs dropped on the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. With such brutal points of reference, one would hope that a third global conflict would be inconceivable. Unfortunately this is not the case. </p>
<p>Those in power tend to want to stay in power, and expand that power when possible. They are most dangerous when their position is threatened.</p>
<p>Geopolitical competitors have risen to challenge the current world order. Alliances are shifting. A confrontation is in the works. 
To avert the worst case scenario we must understand how and why we got here; the motives and the stakes. A short history lesson is in order.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of World War II, the global financial system was restructured at Bretton Woods. Uncle Sam held the biggest stick, so of course he wrote the rules. Under the Bretton Woods agreement, which was finalized in 1945, the U.S. dollar became the world reserve currency. International trade would henceforth be settled with Federal Reserve notes, which were to be backed by gold at $35 per ounce.</p>
<p>This agreement, however, did not take into account the inflationary effects of fractional reserve banking. As long as banks are allowed to loan out more money than they actually have, the money supply always grows. As the money supply grows, the value of that currency decreases. </p>
<p>In the years that followed, debt and inflation skyrocketed, the commitment to allow countries to withdraw their gold at $35 dollars an ounce became more and more problematic. The situation finally came to a head in 1971, when President Nixon ended the gold standard once and for all.</p>

I have directed the secretary of the treasury to take the action necessary to defend the dollar against the speculators. I directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets except in amounts and conditions determined in the interest of monetary stability, and in the best interest of the United States.
<strong>Richard Nixon - August 15, 1971</strong>

<p>In 1973 the Nixon administration began secret negotiations with the government of Saudi Arabia to establish what came to be referred to as the petrodollar recycling system. Under the arrangement the Saudis would only sell their oil in U.S. dollars, and would invest the majority of their excess oil profits into U.S. banks and capital markets.</p>
<p><a href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/135931.pdf" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Documents released by the Congressional Research Service</a> reveal that the negotiations with Saudi Arabia had an edge to them. While proposing new channels of economic and military cooperation, U.S. officials were openly discussing the feasibility of seizing Saudi oil fields by force. Carrot or the stick. This was a deal they couldn&#x2019;t refuse.</p>
<blockquote>In the United States, the oil shocks produced inflation, new concern about foreign investment from oil producing countries, and <strong>open speculation about the advisability and feasibility of militarily seizing oil fields in Saudi Arabia or other countries.</strong> In the wake of the embargo, both Saudi and U.S. officials worked to re-anchor the bilateral relationship on the basis of shared opposition to Communism, renewed military cooperation, and through economic initiatives that promoted the recycling of Saudi petrodollars to the United States via Saudi investment in infrastructure, industrial expansion, and U.S. securities.
</blockquote>

<p>The agreement was formalized in 1974 with <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.gao.gov/products/ID-79-7" target="_blank">&#x201C;The U.S.-Saudi Arabian Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation&#x201D;</a>.  By 1975 the petrodollar system was expanded to include the rest of OPEC, and the U.S. dollar became the only way to purchase oil on the global market. </p>
<p>Oil isn&#x2019;t just a commodity, it&#x2019;s a socio-economic chokepoint. With an economic paradigm that requires infinite growth, the demand for oil must increase as well. This demand for oil translates into demand for dollars. It is this demand that gives the dollar its value. The dollar is an oil backed currency. </p>
<p>With the dollar tied to oil, money became America&#x2019;s primary export. Dollars go out, products and services come in, and inflation is distributed across the entire planet like a hidden tax. </p>
<p>Those who profit from this chokepoint know that their position must be guarded and maintained. If a large enough block of oil producing countries stop selling in dollars, or if fossil fuels alternatives ever gain traction, it would be game over. The dollar would plummet. The U.S. financial system would collapse. The luxurious standard of living that Americans have come to take for granted would be brought to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>The-powers-that-be have a clear incentive to keep the world hooked on fossil fuels, and debt-based money and a motive to crush any nation that challenges their petrodollar monopoly. Examples must be made of upstarts. Sanctions, regime change, Uncle Sam&#x2019;s big stick. </p>

<p>To that end, U.S. military spending steadily increased in the years following World War II, until it had eclipsed that of all other countries combined. The weapons industry grew to be an integral part of the economy, and developed symbiotic relationships with big oil, media, banking, and the political establishment to further their shared interests. Aggressive lobbying, think tanks, and campaign contributions work in tandem.</p>
<p>There are profits on the line. Jobs that depend on war and fossil fuel consumption. The U.S. dollar, the current world reserve currency, also just happens to be tied to that consumption. This equation breeds moral hazard.</p>
<p>With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 the United States became the world&#x2019;s sole, uncontested superpower. All restraints on foreign policy were removed. Public opinion became the only obstacle. Washington took full advantage of this new position.</p>

<blockquote>
About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, &#x201C;Sir, you&#x2019;ve got to come in and talk to me a second.&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;Well, you&#x2019;re too busy.&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;No, no.&#x201D; He says, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve made the decision we&#x2019;re going to war with Iraq.&#x201D; This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to war with Iraq? Why?&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I guess they don&#x2019;t know what else to do.&#x201D; So I said, &#x201C;Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;No, no.&#x201D; He says, &#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I guess it&#x2019;s like we don&#x2019;t know what to do about terrorists, but we&#x2019;ve got a good military and we can take down governments.&#x201D; And he said, &#x201C;I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.&#x201D;
So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, &#x201C;Are we still going to war with Iraq?&#x201D; And he said, &#x201C;Oh, it&#x2019;s worse than that.&#x201D; He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, &#x201C;I just got this down from upstairs&#x201D; &#x2014; meaning the Secretary of Defense&#x2019;s office &#x2014; &#x201C;today.&#x201D; And he said, &#x201C;This is a memo that describes how we&#x2019;re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.&#x201D;

<p>In September of 2000 <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/10/30/iraq.un.euro.reut/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Saddam Hussein moved Iraq&#x2019;s oil sales off of the dollar</a>. Three years later the U.S. invaded under the pretext of &#x201C;weapons of mass destruction&#x201D;. </p>
<p>Weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction&#x2026; Saddam was an imminent threat. He was actively organizing an attack. We could not afford to wait. The American public fell for for the propaganda hook line and sinker.</p>
<p>The weapons didn&#x2019;t exist. Minor detail.</p>
<p>The chaos that followed a vicious sectarian conflict erupted. Sunnis vs. Shiite. Extremism was on the rise. Large scale death and destruction tends to have that effect. Sunnis militants we radicalizing and gaining battle field experience. In the early stages they were referred to as Al Qaeda in Iraq. They later rebranded as ISIS.</p>
<p>In February of 2009 Muammar Gaddafi, was named chairman of the African Union. He immediately <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/world/africa/03africa.html?_r=0" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">proposed the formation of a unified currency for all of Africa.</a> One month later the African Union <a href="http://ea.au.int/en/sites/default/files/DOCUMENT_EN_FR_2_4_MARCH_2009_EA_CONGRESS_ARTICLE_VOLUME_1.pdf" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">released a document entitled &#x201C;Towards a Single African Currency&#x201D;.</a> which made it clear that this new African currency would be backed by gold.</p>
<p>Two years later <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/cia-sends-teams-libya-us-considers-rebel-aid-20110331-065759-284.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">the CIA moved into Libya</a> and began routing money and weapons to insurgents. This time the pretext was &#x201C;humanitarian&#x201D;.  Armed militants were depicted civilian freedom fighters.</p>
<p>These CIA backed rebels <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8407047/Libyan-rebel-commander-admits-his-fighters-have-al-Qaeda-links.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">had direct ties to Al-Qaeda in Iraq</a> (aka ISIS). Again, minor detail.</p>
<p>The U.S. and NATO then established a no-fly-zone, and <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/29/world/la-fg-obama-libya-20110329" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">crippled the Libyan government with airstrikes</a>. Gaddafi was then captured by the rebels and brutally executed in the streets. </p>
<p>Libya, which prior to the war had the highest standard of living in all of Africa, descended into chaos.</p>
<p>In 2011 <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903591104576467631289250392?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424053111903591104576467631289250392.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Bashar Assad forged a pact with Iraq and Iran</a> to run a gas pipeline through Syria <a href="http://www.armedforcesjournal.com/pipeline-politics-in-syria/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">rejecting a western backed proposal</a> for a line which was to run from Qatar, through Saudi Arabia and Syria to Turkey. By 2012 the U.S. and its allies were actively working topple the Syrian government.</p>

<p>To arm this new insurgency, the Libyan armories were looted, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/world/africa/in-a-turnabout-syria-rebels-get-libyan-weapons.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">massive quantities of weapons</a> (including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles) <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/middleeast/article3537770.ece" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">were smuggled into Syria through Turkey</a>. </p>
<p>This support continued even though it was known that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/world/middleeast/jihadists-receiving-most-arms-sent-to-syrian-rebels.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">most of the weaponry was ending up in the hands of extremists</a>.</p>
<p>The Syrian war marked a geopolitical turning point. In 2013 a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22424188" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">U.N. investigation found that the U.S. backed rebels had used sarin gas against civilians</a>. Russian investigators confirmed these findings. The western media and political establishment did everything in their power to pin the blame on Assad and build the case for war, but they were unable to control the narrative.</p>
<p>After two decades of passively watching the United States use military force with impunity, Russia finally took a stand. As U.S. backed militants reached critical mass, and began conquering vast swaths of territory within Syria and Iraq, Russia moved in to provide air support and advanced anti-aircraft systems to the Syrian government, effectively reversing the course of the conflict. </p>
<p>In parallel Russia consolidated alliances with Iran and Iraq, drew Turkey into the fold, and locked arms with China, unifying the Eurasian Union and New Silk Road projects. The balance of power shifted. Washington&#x2019;s era of uncontested dominance was over.</p>
<p>In March of 2018, after years of quietly building up its gold reserves, China launched the PetroYuan. Oil could now be purchased on the global market without U.S. dollars. That same year Russia announced the completion of their own alternative to the SWIFT bank transfer system. The European Union followed suit and began work on a &#x201C;Special Purpose Vehicle&#x201D; to bypass U.S. sanctions on Iran. Unilateral sanctions only work if there&#x2019;s no where else to go.</p>
<p>The petrodollar is in its final days, but the U.S. won&#x2019;t go down without a fight.</p>

<p>These are perilous waters. Current U.S. military doctrine has pivoted from the war on terror to preparing for a confrontation of great powers. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-china-russia/pentagon-puts-countering-china-russia-at-center-of-u-s-defense-strategy-idUSKBN1F81TR" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Russia and China are in the crosshairs</a>.</p>
<p><div class="video_wrapper_outer"><div class="video_wrapper"><iframe class="lazy" width="580" height="326" src="/ajax_html/site/loading.html" data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_EYUNoq_HVs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>
<p>Economic and covert provocations are underway. Proxy wars are ongoing, and direct conflict has been narrowly avoided on numerous occasions. </p>
<p>Geopolitical brinkmanship is nothing new for Uncle Sam, but this time is different. Collectively, the participants in this showdown have thousands of nuclear warheads locked and loaded. Each of these weapons are thousands of times more powerful than those used by the United States against Japan in World War II.</p>
<p>Just 50 to 100 <strong><em>Hiroshima</em></strong> sized bombs, set off anywhere on the planet, would send 5 million tons of debris into the upper atmosphere, reducing global temperatures by about 1.25 degrees centigrade. It would also reduce rainfall worldwide for up to a decade. This would would have a devastating impact on agriculture, and experts predict that mass starvation on a global scale would result.</p>
<p>If 300 of Russia&#x2019;s bombs were set off in the United States somewhere between 75 and 100 million people would die in the first half hour. Most of the infrastructure needed to support the population would be instantly destroyed: communication systems, hospitals, transport, power plants, etc&#x2026; The rest of the population, those who were not killed in this first half hour would most likely die in the coming months from radiation poisoning, starvation, exposure, and disease. </p>
<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. The debris from these explosions would render the planet earth an uninhabitable wasteland. Virtually all complex life forms would go extinct. Our species would not be exempt.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But no one would ever be foolish enough to actually use these weapons in this day and age. That would be a mass suicide (mutually assured destruction).&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is a rational response, one that assumes we are dealing with rational people. Unfortunately a poisonous strain of groupthink has been metastasizing among the U.S. foreign policy establishment and has become codified in official strategy.</p>
<p>Section 1063 of the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt479/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt479.pdf" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">National Defense Authorization Act of 2013</a>  directed the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command to prepare a report assessing the capability of the U.S. military to destroy a network of tunnels in China and &#x201C;the known hardened and deeply buried sites of foreign nations&#x201D; with &#x201C;conventional and or <strong>nuclear forces</strong>&#x201C;</p>
<p>In parallel, the U.S. developed <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/americas-nuclear-bomb-gets-makeover" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">a new version of the B61-12</a>, a guided, variable yield tactical nuke specifically designed with earth penetration capabilities. This weapon changes the game, because it is widely considered &#x201C;usable&#x201D;. </p>
<blockquote>
If I can drive down the yield, drive down, therefore, the likelihood of fallout, et cetera, does that make it more usable in the eyes of some &#x2014; some president or national security decision-making process? And the answer is, it likely could be more usable.
<strong>GEN. JAMES CARTWRIGHT (RET.) - Former Commander, U.S. Strategic Command</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>The trouble with this line of thought, is that it does not take into account the chain of events that the use of small scale tactical nuclear weapons would set in motion. Nor does it account for the wisdom, competence or even sanity of those holding the &#x201C;usable&#x201D; option.</p>
<p>Unlike China, neither the United States nor Russia have committed to a <strong>No First Use</strong> nuclear doctrine. The United States has already used these weapons in war, has threatened to use them again, has directed its military to develop a plan to knock out deep underground bunkers and tunnels by conventional or nuclear means, and has developed the B61-12 guided tactical nuke for this exact purpose. This equation is incredibly dangerous. To pretend otherwise would be delusional.</p>
