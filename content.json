This vision must resonate, and inspire action; action towards concrete goals, minimal starting points that provide immediate and tangible benefits. The code must be synchronized with reality. It must adapt to logic and evidence (the scientific method applied to the way humans learn, organize and live). The code must be open source. It must be simple, modular (meme level), and compatible with a broad spectrum of existing ideologies. It must work with (rather than against) our instinctual psychology. It must be adapted to human biochemistry. We don&#x2019;t have time to reinvent the wheel. We must learn from the lessons of history, and the innovations of the modern age. Take the best of the old and the new. Integrate what works and discard what doesn&#x2019;t."},{"title":"Activism","date":"July 30, 2017","updated":"July 30, 2017","path":"activism/index.html","permalink":"http://paradigmforthenextgeneration.com/activism/index.html","excerpt":"","text":"Local Activism Digital Activism Downloads Contact Guidelines Volunteer Activism begins with a commitment to speak out on one or more issues consistently. To maximize our effectiveness, psychology and identity must be taken into account. PsychologyStudies have demonstrated that repetition creates the impression that an idea is widespread (thereby sparking social conformity and contagion) even if the ideas in question originate from a single source. In any given population you will find very few people that truly think for themselves. Most are carried along by social conformity or follow the lead of a supposed authority. The Asch conformity experiments, and the Milgram authority experiments demonstrate this clearly. If the forces of conformity and authority are currently holding humanity on a destructive course, it is up to us to turn the tide. The Asch experiments demonstrated that even one voice of dissent is enough to break the power of misguided conformity (the emperor wears no clothes). Ideas are more likely to take root when they are voiced authoritatively, and repetitively. Multiple voices working in coordination can amplify this effect, and create waves that take on a life of their own. IdentityMost large cultures comprised of multiple subcultures. Within any given western country you will find a myriad of religious, political, and ideological identities (as well as countless identities formed over trivia such as musical tastes, or sports teams). These identities heavily influence the way ideas are perceived and integrated. Effective activists take the various group identities of the target audience into account at all times and tailor their message to avoid triggering cognitive dissonance. This often implies using old words for new ideas, or new words for old ideas. Example: the term &#x201C;sustainability&#x201D; has a negative connotation among conservatives in the United States, while &#x201C;local resilience&#x201D; does not."},{"title":"404","date":"July 24, 2016","updated":"April 05, 2017","path":"error/404.html","permalink":"http://paradigmforthenextgeneration.com/error/404.html","excerpt":"","text":"The page you are looking for does not exist.

In systems design this principle is referred to as modularity. Richard Dawkins coined the term &#x201C;meme&#x201D; to represent minimal clusters of ideas. In the context of an ideological system we can use &#x201C;module&#x201D; and &#x201C;meme&#x201D; interchangeably. The following modules/memes are designed to be combined and integrated into existing ideologies. To maximize cultural reach, we must embrace hybrid systems. Core Modules Local Resilience Peaceful Continuity Adaptive Action Modularity Tribal Identity Core NarrativeThe core modules can be tied together by narrative to form a meme system. Local resilience implies converging, forming coalitions, and teams, getting our local community involved. Non-aggression, conflict resolution, and consensus building will make the transition more peaceful. The adaptive approach will make us more effective.

Start by seeking a point of resonance right away and expand from there. Among the general population local resilience is usually the most accessible meme to start with, however within some niche groups (such as a conflict resolution meet-up, or an Agile development forum) one of the other core modules may be a more appropriate starting point. Make sure you know the core modules (local resilience, adaptive action, modularity, peaceful continuity, and tribal identity) backwards and forwards. One way to achieve this is to immerse yourself in documentaries, books and articles on related topics. Taking notes and reformulating the ideas into your own words will help you integrate them more deeply. Engaging in respectful and calm debate with those who disagree with you is an important test of both intellectual and emotional development. Seek first to understand. Teach by asking questions. Prioritize the relationship over the short term win. Be humble enough to acknowledge when you don&#x2019;t have an answer. If in the course of a conversation you are confronted with an idea that you do not know how to respond to, this should be viewed as an opportunity to deepen your research. Under no circumstances should you pretend to know or understand something that you do not."},{"title":"Digital Activism","date":"July 30, 2017","updated":"July 30, 2017","path":"activism/digital/index.html","permalink":"http://paradigmforthenextgeneration.com/activism/digital/index.html","excerpt":"","text":"The internet provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to disseminate ideas on a global scale.

Cities and highways are designed with automobiles in mind. Food production, industry and office complexes moved farther and farther away from suburban sprawl. And all of it at the mercy of a debt based monetary system whose ebbs and flows we do not control, a system predicated on infinite growth on a finite planet. Local resilience is a modular component (meme). This meme contains an implied replication imperative (the urgency to transition off of a dying system).

Non-aggression - Never initiate violence. Conflict Resolution - Develop the skills needed to calm tempers and deescalate tensions. The ability to maintain peace and security within a group, and in relation to neighboring groups is vital. This duty is, and has always been our responsibility. However for generations we have outsourced these functions to other groups of humans, often thousands of miles away, who claim the monopoly on violence, money and truth within a given region. As the current system weakens, this responsibility must be picked up again on a community level. The transition must be guided by principle. Most would agree that it&#x2019;s &#x201C;not right&#x201D; to punch the neighborhood kid in the face and take his toy. But where does that feeling of &#x201C;NOT RIGHT!&#x201D; or &#x201C;That&#x2019;s NOT OK!&#x201D; come from? Some frame the concept of non-aggression as a moral principle, but moral principles could also be described as expressions of the tribal instinct. Such principles resonate deeply in the human psyche, and are easily reawakened because for eons they have facilitated the stability (and therefore survival) of groups which hold to them. This assertion can be tested. Game theory has established that the most successful strategy in experiments modeled around conflict, is tit for tat: never attack, retaliate in kind. Tit for tat was a mathematically consistent selective pressure (those who attack first reduce their chance of survival). Instincts are adapted to that pressure. This is why every human culture has some concept of the right to self defense. It&#x2019;s also why most societies condemn aggression, and why states always claim to be attacked when they want to start a war. The retaliation instinct is counter balanced by empathy. Conflict resolution and consensus building improve outcomes by preventing long cycles of retaliation, and averting escalations before they start."},{"title":"Tribal Identity","date":"July 30, 2017","updated":"July 31, 2017","path":"modules/tribal-identity/index.html","permalink":"http://paradigmforthenextgeneration.com/modules/tribal-identity/index.html","excerpt":"","text":"Homo Sapiens Sapiens is a social animal. National identity is a proxy for tribe. Tribe is the human analogue of a pack (cultural modularity). In the early 1970s social psychologist Henri Tajfel set out to study the minimal conditions required for discrimination to occur between groups of humans. In his tests he discovered that group identity could be easily formed in a very short time using trivial criteria (such as one&#x2019;s musical preferences or the results of a coin toss), and that groups divided by such trivia would immediately display prejudice against those on the other side,and favor those in the same arbitrary category. He referred to this principle as The Minimal Group Paradigm. It&#x2019;s the psychological root of tribal identity. This instinct pre-dates humanity, and will persist. Failure to account for it invites tragedy. The pack instinct is a survival adaptation. It is triggered by physical insecurity. Those who are able to coordinate their efforts with those around them are able to accomplish exponentially more than those who attempt to go it alone. This provides a selective pressure that will always come into play during times of upheaval. Groups which define and maintain a strong shared identity are more stable than those which do not.
